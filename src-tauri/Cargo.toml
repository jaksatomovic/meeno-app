# If enabled, code that relies on pizza_engine will be activated.
#
# Only do this if:
# 1. Pizza engine is listed in the `dependencies` section
#  
# ```toml
# [dependencies]
# pizza-engine = { git = "ssh://git@github.com/infinilabs/pizza.git", features = ["query_string_parser", "persistence"] }
# ```
#
# 2. It is a private repo, you have access to it.
#
# So, for external contributors, do NOT enable this feature.
# 
# Previously, We listed it in the dependencies and marked it optional, but cargo 
# would fetch all the dependencies regardless of wheterh they are optional or not, 
# so we removed it.
